# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!

# Javascript tutorial
javascript is a versatile programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It allows you to implement complex features on web pages, such as dynamically updating content, controlling multimedia, animating images, and much more.

## Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare a variable using three keywords: var, let, and const.

```jsx
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```
