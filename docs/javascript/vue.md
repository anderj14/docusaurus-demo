#Vue

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. Itâ€™s designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use as much or as little of it as you need. Here are some key features:

1. Declarative Rendering: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows you to declaratively describe your UI.

2. Component-Based Architecture: Vue encourages building applications using small, reusable components.
